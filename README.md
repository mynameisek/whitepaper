## Abstract
All successful projects have one critical success factor in common: the active engagements by their members. Without these engagements, projects cannot achieve the tractions they need to gain further access to financial resources. Members’ engagements can be, and should be viewed as a non-financial investment in the projects. But in today’s world, this concept is invalidated by the giant companies who act as a central governing power to monopolize revenue models and pay no reward to the above non-financial investment.

By converting members’ engagements into tokens, members can invest in projects with non-financial, or “sweat” capitals: their time, attention and even reputations spent on the projects. Early “sweat capitalists” are effectively the angel investors to the projects. Angel investment is no longer a privilege of the rich. Projects still need financial resources to thrive. But with sweat capital, projects can save more effort and hence can focus more on their users.

To achieve this vision, we need to build a community of members who make valuable engagements, have good reputations and are willing to help each other. This is a community with sound decentralized governance.

Here we present Forbole, a blockchain that will serve as a decentralized ecosystem based on endorsements, recommendations and referrals. As members, we endorse the skills and give recommendations to people we really know and trust, and hence we help each other to build reputations. Each member will unleash the potential of one’s circle of influence and create a positive effect on other circles nearby. All these user engagements, or contributions to our community, will be recorded on our Forbole which use Tendermint as consensus engine and will be part of the Cosmos Network. 

Forbole will adopt a multi-tokens model. Desmos will be the staking token and is not intended to be used to pay fees. Phanero, on the other hand, will be the fee tokens to reward members who have made contributions.

Forbole will evolve into a decentralized crowdfunding platform and become a hub for other blockchain projects. Users will then be able to support new blockchain projects through currencies, tokens or sweat capitals easily.
## Problems 

Our objective is to solve below three problems. They may seem unrelated to each other at first glance, but you will see how they are interconnected.

### Entry barrier of blockchain space

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are the buzziest words now. While a lot of people talk about these, not so many people have actually participated in them. The entry barrier of blockchain space are still quite high to general public. How to attract more layman to join this era of blockchain?

### Corrupted social networks

Another problem we want to solve is the corruption of current social networking giants. They monopolize the revenue model, abuse the use of data, and reward nothing to engaging users who have contributed to the successes of the social networks. Can we have a better business model of social networks which align the interests of the users and the communities?

### Tractions vs kickstart capital

Thirdly, early-stage businesses are required to gain tractions before they can successfully pitch investors. But they also need the kickstart capital in order to gain these tractions. There is a chicken or egg problem. How to help these early-stage businesses?
## Proof-of-Contributions

Our direct approach is to tokenize contributions made by members. We do this through proof-of-contributions. Here is the rationale of our mechanism.

### Community that incentivise users’ contributions

By building a community of users who are willing to help each other, it will provide the source of tractions early-stage businesses need. Through a decentralized governance and incentive mechanism, we can redistribute the rewards to users who have made contributions to the community. Through an appropriate user experience design, we can encourage layman to use our platform and join the blockchain space.

Forbole is a decentralized ecosystem for users to support each other through financial capitals (currencies or tokens) or non-financial “sweat” capitals (attentions, engagements and reputations).   To achieve this goal, we start by developing a business social network for users to make recommendations and refer business or career opportunities to each other. After we have reached the critical mass of users, we will evolve the network to become a decentralized token crowdfunding platform. 

### Failure of existing business models

The reason for the corruption of existing social network is its business model. Take LinkedIn as an example. LinkedIn derives its major revenue from membership fee paid by premium users, who are mainly headhunters or salespeople. By becoming a premium user, you can enjoy more privileges to explore the profiles that match your appetite and contact them more freely. While premium users are hunting for sales leads or candidates’ profiles, who want to become their prey?

Another example is Facebook. In March 2018, the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal was reported, which involves the collection of personally identifiable information of up to 87 million Facebook users and almost certainly a much greater number that Cambridge Analytica began collecting in 2014. The data was allegedly used to attempt to influence voter opinion on behalf of politicians who hired them.

The business model of existing social networks is the main reason why they are no longer able to meet users’ expectation.

### Extending offline trust to online community

To improve the business model of a social network, we need to minimize, if not eliminate, the power of centralized governance and redistribute its responsibilities and rewards to contributors to the community. So we need to have a sound mechanism to calculate the contributions made by members. Contributions mainly come from the users’ engagements.

We are not the first one to think of incentivizing users’ engagements of online platform. So far we have not heard of many successful cases (there is exception, though, such as Steemit and DelegateCall which we think are doing great). One of the most criticized aspect of incentivizing users on online platforms is that this will also encourage fake accounts and spammy activities. 

To ensure the quality of our members, we integrate the law of reciprocity and the wisdom of the crowd to build grow community.

### Word-of-mouth referral and the law of reciprocity

When we need help, we will ask our trusted friends. If our friends cannot help, they will ask their trusted friends. This is where word-of-mouth referrals happen. By making referrals, we are not just helping the people we trust to seize opportunities, but also the people who need help to get the right solutions.

To facilitate referrals, members need to know who are reputable. Your reputation is what other people think about you. Our platform motivates members to endorse the skills of each other. They can further make recommendations or testimonials about each other. That means members help each other to build reputation. This is driven by the law of reciprocity, and reflected by our reward in tokens.

### Wisdom of the crowd

After a member has made engagements such as endorsements, recommendations and referrals of opportunities, other members can rate or comment these recommendations (eg. by adopting meta-moderation). Members can also certify the profile information of other members.

We also plan to adopt and localize some ideas from solidarity lending. Solidarity lending is a lending practice where small groups borrow collectively and group members encourage one another to repay. It is an important building block of microfinance. We will modify our algorithm to calculate contributions to reflect the contribution as a group in order to encourage members to help each other to make contributions and build reputations.

### Examples of engagements as contributions

At our early-stage, below are some examples of engagements in the algorithm to calculate contributions made by a member:

 1) Endorse skills of others
 2) Write recommendations
 3) Accept endorsement or recommendation
 4) Become a user
 5) Certify the information of other members
 6) Convert a non-member to become a member
 7) Make referrals of opportunities
 8) Accept/follow-up the referrals 
 9) Upvote/Downvote the engagements of other users
 10) The engagements have been upvoted

### Contribution Score

By gamifying the process of business networking, we advocate the mindset that one can become successful by helping others to succeed: your ability of acknowledging other people’s credentials is your asset.

Users will be entitled a Contribution Score. Contributions Score is an aggregate figure calculated through our algorithm using above engagements as parameters. This is a kind of recognition regarding the contribution made by a user.

> Note: We are still finalizing the computation of Contribution Score. Some questions are yet answered. Will Contribution Score decrease? May it have some more constructive roles instead of just a recognition for self-actualization purpose?

## Decentralized Tokens Crowdfunding

Our dream is to create a platform for businesses of all scales to get funded by both financial and non-financial capitals. After we have reached a critical mass of reputable and engaging members, we will go on to develop the decentralized tokens crowdfunding platform (“DTCP”).

### The meaning of decentralized tokens platform

Due to technological limitation, most of the tokens exchanges are centralized in nature, which means they are subject to problems a centralized system would face, such as hacks and theft.

With the use of development tool such as Cosmos SDK, a truly decentralized token exchange platform will become real. We can further apply the concept of Internet of Blockchain to develop our own startups ecosystem.

### Centralization of ICO

We think ICO has failed to help startups to raise fund as it costs to too much. According to a post on Bitcoin Market Journal, the costs just to launch an ICO is ranged from $100,000 to $500,000, not include listing your tokens on exchange, which can cost you millions. Even post series-A startups would feel suffocated by the all-in costs of ICO.

ICO has become a private clubhouse of VCs, ICO advisors, lawyers and other so-called experts. This is a monopoly that is sugarcoated with the terms of decentralization.

### Combining decentralized social network and crowdfunding

On our platform, business owner can gain tractions through endorsements and recommendations, and affiliate or referral marketing. In fact, the business owner is in crowdfunding mode: raise non-financial capital from the engagements of users.

With this user base, it is easier for business owner to raise kickstart funding through crowdfunding as the project is gaining tractions.

## Token Model

### Tribute to Cosmos

We are using Cosmos SDK to develop our project. Cosmos team has taken some revolutionary actions such as its multi-tokens model and the hard spoon on Ethereum to create Ethermint. Instead of designing our tokens model from scratch, we will do this by customizing on the well-thought-out token model and governance structure of the Cosmos Hub, which is a blockchain that hosts a multi-asset distributed ledger and is the first zone on Cosmos Ecosystem. This allows us to focus more on our contribution-driven tokenomics and the user experience design of our product. 

### The necessity of multi-tokens model

In the token model of the Cosmos Hub, it is stated that:

“......In this single token model, the economic utility of said token is twofold: staking and transactional. This introduces more liquidity into the token as greater utility is bundled into a single token, and creates less of an incentive for people to stake their tokens. What’s more worrisome is that greater liquidity results in weaker network security, allowing potential attackers to stealthily accrue the amount of tokens necessary to attack a Proof-of-Stake system…...”

Steem, another outstanding blockchain project that we have referred to, has addressed the importance of stability for successful economies:

“There is significant value to having long-term commitment because it enables communities to make long-term plans. Long term commitment of stakeholders also causes them to vote for long-term growth rather than short-term pumps.” (P.8, Steem’s Whitepaper)

Although the multi-tokens model of Steem and Cosmos Hub are quite different, they share a common goal - incentivize their users to make longer term contributions to the projects.

Forbole will adopt a multi-tokens model that it similar to the Cosmos Hub. “Desmo” will be the staking token to secure our ecosystem while “Phanero” will be the fee tokens to reward members who have made contributions.

### Roles on Forbole: keepers and users

Similar to Cosmos Hub, there will be two primary classed of actors in Forbole, which are the keepers and users. The keepers help to operate and maintain the blockchain network, while the users derive some utility from the network.

### Desmo

Desmo, inspired from Greek word desmós (δεσμός) which means “bond, relationship”, is the staking tokens on Forbole. Similar to Atom of Cosmos Hub, Desmos are a license for the holder to vote, validate, or delegate to other validators in Forbole. 

There will be an inflation of 5 - 20% of the total supply of Desmos per annum. Most of the inflation will be rewarded to stakers. 

> Note: We are still thinking of the way to avoid the rich is getting richer which may discourage late but qualified newcomers to join the governance. For example, is this possible to allocate a small portion of Desmo inflation as a reward to Phanero holders such that newcomers have a chance to earn the illiquid Desmo by making more contributions in the social network?     

### Phanero

Phanero, inspired from Greek word phanerós (φανερός) which means “visible, manifest, evident”, is the fee tokens on Forbole. In fact, we first knew about this word from Jae Kwon, the founder of Tendermint, in his speech in CryptoEconomics Security Conference 2017 which said: 

“...... I feel like, between crypto and economics there’s another word that’s missing which stands for the transparency, so maybe crypto economics should be crypto phanero economics ……” 
(note: the word “crypto” is from Ancient Greek (κρυπτός) which means “hidden”)

The literal meaning of phanerós aligns with the rationale of our contributions tokenomics - we encourage our users to contribute to our community by helping each other to build reputations through endorsements, recommendations, and referrals. Users are incentivised to become more visible. 

Phanero block reward will be minted at a constant rate of 24,000 Phaneros per day. Most of them will be rewarded to users according to their Contribution Score

### Proposed hard spoon on Steem 

According to Steem’s whitepaper: 

“Steem is a blockchain database that supports community building and social interaction with cryptocurrency rewards. Steem combines concepts from social media with lessons learned from building cryptocurrencies and their communities. An important key to inspiring participation in any community, currency or free market economy is a fair accounting system that consistently reflects each person's contribution. Steem is the first cryptocurrency that attempts to accurately and transparently reward an unbounded number of individuals who make subjective contributions to its community.”

While Steem focus more on the creation of quality contents, Forbole focus more on the creation of quality relationships. 

Cosmos’s team has performed a hard spoon on Ethereum to create Ethermint. According to Jae Kwon, hard spoon is “a new chain that takes into account state from an existing chain; not to compete, but to provide broad access.”  

If hard spoon on Ethereum can be done, how about hard spoon on Steem? If this will be executed, we will distribute all Steem holders an adjusted amount of Phanero, which is our fee token. We are still studying the feasibility, the fairness and the costs and benefits of this hard spoon. In any case, there will not be a crowdsale for the Phanero.

> Note: There are some more uncertainty about hard spoon on Steem. For example, is this fair to other users who will make contributions? Is this action worth to do in the first place? Why a hard spoon and why Steem?

## Fundraiser

We plan to launch a Fundraiser to collect donations to support our initiatives. We will do so by distributing Desmo to the donors of the Fundraiser. According to our development plan and style, we expect the Fundraiser will consist of a series of private rounds before a public crowdsale round.

### [Blockchain Foundation] and Forbole Limited

[Blockchain Foundation (“BF”, name is subject to change)] is a non-profit foundation to be setup in [name of jurisdiction]. Its purpose is to conduct the Fundraiser designed to collect donations and to contract with entities and their agents for the development of Forbole and its relevant projects and activities (“Forbole’s Project”).

BF is planning a Fundraiser for future staking tokens, called "Desmos", that give the holder limited license to validate Forbole and DCFP. The contributions made in connection with the Fundraiser will go to the BF to develop Forbole’s Project.

Forbole Limited (“FL”) is a for-profit limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong in October 2017. BF has contracted with FL to develop Forbole’s Project. The team of FL will be the core developer team of Forbole’s Project. As of the date of this Whitepaper, FL is majority-owned by Kwun Yeung and Terence Lam. 

### Initial Token Distribution

On Genesis, the initial token supply will be 200,000,000 of Desmos. Initial distribution on genesis is as follows:

Donors: 65% (130,000,000 Desmos)
FL:		  20% (40,000,000 Desmos)
BF:		  15% (30,000,000 Desmos)

Donors include all the donors at different stage of the Fundraiser. We design our Fundraiser to reflect our actual need. Prior to the public crowdsale, we plan 3 private rounds and 1 public round as follow:

| Periods | Fundraise Target | Desmos price | Number of Desmos | % of initial supply | Main usage |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1st to 31rd Jul 2018 | USD 120,000- | USD 0.06 | 2,000,000 | 1% | BF administration and software development |
| 1st to 31st Aug 2018 | USD 210,000- | USD 0.07 | 3,000,000 | 1.5% | Software and community development |
| 1st to 30th Sep 2018 | USD 400,000- | USD 0.08 | 5,000,000 | 2.5% | Software and community development |
| 1st to 30th Nov 2018 | USD 12,000,000 (hardcap) | USD 0.1 | 120,000,000 | 60% | Software and community development |

Please be reminded again that Phanero, the fee tokens on Forbole, will not have crowdsale.

## Reasons for using Cosmos SDK

There are some reasons why we chose Cosmos but not the more common Ethereum.

### A Decentralized Ecosystem

Forbole Network is a business social network. There will be a lot user generated contents and user engagements. We aim to create a decentralized ecosystem which quantifies user engagements. Although Ethereum is the most popular platform for building ÐApps, the limited functionalities of Solidity and slow transaction speed on EVM cannot fulfill our requirements. So we decided to build our own blockchain with better performance while users can join and become parts of the governance.

Among various blockchain technologies, we chose Cosmos SDK. Cosmos SDK provides a set tools for developers to build their own blockchains. With these tools, we can build whatever applications we like without the limitation of the current Ethereum network. It lets us create our own tokens and governance modules which can truly make Forbole a decentralized community.

### Proof-of-stake consensus engine

Cosmos SDK is built on Tendermint as the backbone consensus engine. In the traditional blockchain communities like Bitcoin and Ethereum, they use Proof-of-Work (“PoW”) as the consensus mechanism. PoW has been criticized from time to time . As the communities grow, its energy consumption skyrockets while the transaction time is getting slower.

It takes minutes or even hours to record a social network engagement on Ethereum, and it is not acceptable for a social network like Forbole. Tendermint is using a classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms which can handle up to thousands of transactions per second.

### Internet of Blockchains

Cosmos is a network of blockchains. It allows different blockchains talk in the IBC protocol to be connected together to form an Internet of Blockchains. Zones can be created to plug any blockchain systems to the Cosmos Hub and exchange tokens among different blockchains. In that sense, we no longer need a centralized exchange to trade tokens, which is subject to hacks and theft. By using Cosmos SDK, we can develop a blockchain to be connected to different zones and the Cosmos Hub to create a truly decentralized token exchange.

### Developer-friendly

On Ethereum, we have to develop ÐApp with Smart Contracts written in Solidity. With Cosmos SDK, we don’t have to consider those complicated P2P network protocol, consensus algorithms or cyber security issues. These are all done by the Tendermint backbone. We can focus on the user experience and the business logic of the application. Module based design also allows us to deploy updates and new features easily.

Tendermint and Cosmos SDK are originally developed with Go, which is a simple and efficient programming language created by Google. Developers can adapt for Cosmos SDK easily and build a blockchain in a short time.

Tendermint and Cosmos SDK communicated via Application-Blockchain Interface (“ABCI”). With this interface, developers can build blockchain applications with any programming languages. If you don’t use Cosmos SDK with Go, you can still connect your application to the Cosmos Network via IBC. For example, you can build a blockchain application with Lotion, a JavaScript framework which communicates with Tendermint via ABCI. With this architecture, it opens up unlimited possibilities for blockchain applications development. Developers with different skill sets can contribute to the Cosmos Network and hence the community can grow.

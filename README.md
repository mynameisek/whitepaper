## Introduction

We have seen more and more problems were created by the corrupted social network service (“SNS”) providers such as Facebook and LinkedIn. These include the unresting scams and spams, the security loopholes, the privacy breaches and the oligopolistic behaviours of these SNS behemoths infringe users’ interests and harm the industry as a whole. People are demanding for a new kind of social networks.

The root of the above problems is the structural deficiency of the business model of these centralized SNS providers. We believe a social network of the users, by the users, for the users will be a solution to reshape the scene of social networking. 

Project Forbole is an initiative to build an ecosystem of decentralized social networks. We advocate for a new business model and a new mindset of social networking. We will achieve this by applying blockchain technology and redefining the roles and mindsets of various players.

This Whitepaper aims at providing a deeper understanding of the scope and value proposition of Project Forbole to the audience who are interested in becoming an early mover in this initiative by participating the first private presale of the native token of ForboleChain, the Desmo Token.

## Project Overview
(graph)

## Forbole Limited

Forbole Limited (“FL”) is a for-profit company limited incorporated in Hong Kong in Oct 2017. The main businesses of FL will be technology solution service and digital asset management. FL is building Big Dipper, ForboleChain and Forbole Referral Network.

At the date of incorporation, FL was cofounded and owned by Kwun Yeung (52%) and Terence Lam (48% on document, while 15% will be an option pool for future employees). As at the date of this Whitepaper, a total angel investment amount of HKD630,000 (USD80,769) has been raised from 12 individuals using [Simple Agreement for Future Equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_agreement_for_future_equity_(SAFE)) (“SAFE”) with the latest market cap of USD1.5 million.

## Cosmos and the internet of blockchains

Project Forbole is a Cosmos/Tendermint ecosystem project. Please refer to the [whitepaper of Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper) to understand the concepts such as validators and consensus, which also apply in Project Forbole.

For the sake of wide adoption of blockchain, there is a need for our audiences to understand the concepts of internet of blockchains in a non-technical way. Please refer to this [layman’s analogy](https://medium.com/forbole/internet-of-blockchain-a-dangerous-laymans-analogy-bb82410d6038).

## ForboleChain
**a blockchain for decentralized social networks**

ForboleChain (“FBC”) is the blockchain we are developing. Powered by Cosmos Hub and Tendermint, FBC is a high-performant and byzantine fault tolerant blockchain based on proof-of-stake consensus.

In Cosmos terminology, a [hub](https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper#the-hub) is a blockchain that hosts a multi-asset distributed ledger, where tokens can be held by individual users or by [zones](https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper#the-zones) themselves. The hub is responsible for preserving the global invariance of the total amount of each token across the zones.

FBC will be a hub connecting to Cosmos Hub and [IRIS Hub](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#iris-network-design), the first regional hub of Cosmos in China. Based on the core developments of Cosmos Hub, FBC will develop its own modules specifically for decentralized social networks, these include the concepts of distributed reputations and contribution-by-engagement.

After reviewing the timeline of Cosmos ecosystem projects and our progress, Q1–2019 is a good timing to launch the testnet of FBC.

### Desmo Token

As of the [atoms](https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper#the-atom-token) of Cosmos Hub, FBC will also have a native utility token called Desmos. The name of Desmo [ˈdɛsmɒ] was inspired from Ancient Greek desmós (δεσμός) which means “bond, relationship”. Desmos are a license for the holder to vote, validate, or delegate to other validators on FBC. Desmos can also be used to pay for transaction fees to mitigate spam.

We suggest an inflation rate of 5–20% of the total supply of Desmos per annum. Inflationary Desmos and block transaction fees are rewarded to validators and delegators who delegate to validators.

## Forbole Referral Network: 
**a decentralized professional fraternity**

FBC is a blockchain for decentralized social networking apps. We will build the first dApp on FBC which is called Forbole Referral Network (“FRN”). FRN is a decentralized business social network based on users engagements that are relating to reputations, such as endorsement of skills, recommendation of profiles and referral of business or career opportunities to other members. These engagements will be encouraged through gamification and [meta-moderation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-moderation_system) design. 

The purpose of FRN is to transform the trust attributes generated from close business relationships into secured, traceable and portable digital assets such that the circle of influence of a user can grow efficiently and various circles can connect with each other base on the same belief: help the people you trust to succeed by referring them opportunities. You can also see FRN as a decentralized professional fraternity.

The beta of FRN will be released in Jan-2019. Please click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPXpLknFB1w) for an animation explainer and [here](https://medium.com/forbole/unveiling-forbole-referral-network-bd78e6c87209) for the draft UX design. Furthermore, we are also planning to rebrand FRN to Phanero after it has acquired for some solid early tractions.

### Phanero Token

Phanero [fəˈnærəʊ] is the token to support the crypto economics of FRN. The name is inspired from Ancient Greek phanerós (φανερός) which means “visible, manifest, evident”. We first knew about this word from Jae Kwon, the cofounder of Cosmos, in his speech in CryptoEconomics Security Conference 2017 (click [here](https://youtu.be/8Eex-wQ5yYU?t=23) for the speech):

“… I feel like, between crypto and economics there’s another word that’s missing which stands for the transparency, so maybe crypto economics should be crypto phanero economics …”

“…there’s this duality between hiding something and sharing something, and what blockchain does or what bitcoin has done it’s shown us a way to coordinate ourselves in a new way by using cryptography to share information and not share information in ways that were not possible before and thereby creating a new ecosystem.”

The literal meaning of phanerós is exactly what we want to achieve in FRN. We encourage users to help each other to build reputations through serious and engaging interactions such as endorsements, recommendations and referrals. Users are incentivised to become more visible.

### Creation of Phaneros

Every new Phanero will be created at a constant rate commencing from genesis except a number of Phanero will be created and distributed to users who have made the contribution-by-engagement before genesis on a one-off basis. In fact, the users’ activities before genesis will also give us valuable insights about the design of Phanero.

Users have to earn the new Phanero purely by “sweat”: making contribution-by-engagement. There will not be any sales of newly created Phaneros. The final details and implementation of Phaneros will be decided by governance on FBC.

## A new business model for social networks with dual-tokens 

We believe in the philosophy of Cosmos to build an ecosystem of connected and interoperable blockchains rather than relying on one single dictating blockchain. We have further discovered that this notion can be integrated with more elements of economics and politics to become our version to create a new era of decentralized social networks. 

A truly decentralized ecosystem need to be diversified and inclusive enough. This is important to connect the visionary layman users and hardcore developers. We achieve this by the Desmo-Phanero dual-tokens business model. FBC and its token Desmo provide the infrastructure for other decentralized social networking apps. FRN and its token Phanero provide an interface for layman users to join blockchain and crypto space. This is the relationship between Desmo and Phanero that makes us special in this space.

### Redefining various stakeholders 

We need a social networking ecosystem of the users, by the users, for the users. This is a movement similar to the French Revolution or abolition of slavery. We are not the first project which claims to disrupt social networks by incentivising users. But this is just one piece of the puzzle. The first important step is to reinvent the mindset of stakeholders of social networks. 

Currently, SNS providers think they are the emperors who own every data of their users (the peasants) and turn that into gold. At the same time, the users (the slaves) are bewitched to work (make engagements) for the SNS providers for free. By adopting the layman’s analogy we mentioned earlier, we want to redefine the stakeholders and entities of Forbole ecosystem as follow:

**The internet of blockchains is the world of nations.**

**FBC is one of these nations. FRN is the first province in FBC.**

**Members of Forbole ecosystem are the citizens with various right depending on the passports they are holding.**

**Validators of FBC are the congressmen of FBC who participate the governance of FBC and sometimes its provinces.**

**Desmo and Phanero are two types of passports that entitle the citizens different rights in Forbole ecosystem.**

**Desmo entitles its holder the partial ownership in FBC. Desmo will be used as the staking token to perform the operation and governance of FBC. Desmo holders will delegate their Desmo to their choices of validators.**

**Phanero entitles its holder the partial ownership in FRN. A funding pool will be created from the income of FRN and used to provide liquidity for Phanero (see below).**

**FL as a company, is the team to serve Forbole ecosystem at various capacities such as service provider, facilitator, tokens holder, validator and investor. **

We are eliminating the preconception that the SNS provider (and its shareholders) is the sole owner of the social network. This is no longer valid and satisfactory. As a social network, FRN is owned by the holders of Phanero. By earning Phanero through contribution-by-engagement, every user can become the owner of FRN.

As such, there is no more saying like “we share profit with users”, as we cannot share things that we do not own. This is the owners of FRN who own its profit, and they share a portion of it with FL as a management fee. 

### Desmo: a new level of ownership

Ownership of FBC means not just economic benefits, but also the right to participate the governance of FBC, which is the backbone for FRN and other Forbole ecosystem projects. While our target early participants of Desmo will be the validators or investors of Cosmos or its ecosystem projects, we also want to encourage FRN users to participate the governance of FBC, directly or indirectly. 

Governments need to educate, encourage and sometimes force their citizens to vote in elections. This is similar in our case. One of our challenges ahead is to educate and encourage users of FRN to participate the governance of FBC by earning, owning and delegating Desmo to their preferred validator candidates. We need to promote civic awareness of a decentralized ecosystem.

On the other hand, this maybe dangerous if laymen users (often outnumber knowledgeable validators and investors) have significant influence on the governance. So we will also see if a system like bicameralism is feasible.

### Phanero: connecting fiat and crypto economics

The idea of FRN was derived from our own experiences in business networking. We know there is a need for recording business interactions securely and transparently such that the true connectors will shine and influence other people. By tokenizing the trusts we generate from the endorsements, recommendations and referrals into portable digital assets, we can extend our close relationships and enlarge our circle of influence, and hence improve the overall reliability of the ecosystem. 

The sources of income of FRN are membership fee and advertising income just like other social networks. To encourage wide adoption, we need to be inclusive enough for fiat currencies user. In early stage, we expect FRN will receive most of its income in fiat. After deducting the management fee for FL, the balance will become a reserve to provide liquidity for Phanero. Ones may regard this reserve as the “buyer of last resort” in the secondary market of Phanero. Through this arrangement, we convert the traditional centralized business model of SNS into a decentralized one where the business of FRN is owned by its true owners: Phanero holders.

# White Paper
The White Paper of Forbole Blockchain
## Abstract
All successful projects have one critical success factor in common: the active engagements by their members. Without these engagements, projects cannot achieve the tractions they need to gain further access to financial resources. Members’ engagements can be, and should be viewed as a non-financial investment in the projects. But in today’s world, this concept is invalidated by the giant companies who act as a central governing power to monopolize revenue models and pay no reward to the above non-financial investment.

By converting members’ engagements into exchangeable tokens, members can invest in projects with non-financial, or “sweat” capitals: their time, attention and even reputations spent on the projects. Early “sweat capitalists” are effectively the angel investors to the projects. Angel investment is no longer a privilege of the rich. Projects still need financial resources to thrive. But with sweat capital, projects can save more effort and hence can focus more on their users.

To achieve this vision, we need to build a community of members who make valuable engagements, have good reputations and are willing to help each other. This is a community with sound decentralized governance.

Here we present Forbole, a decentralized ecosystem based on endorsements, recommendations and referrals. As members, we endorse the skills and give recommendations to people we really know and trust, and hence we help each other to build reputations. Each member will unleash the potential of one’s circle of influence and create a positive effect on other circles nearby. All these user engagements will be recorded on our Forbole Blockchain which use Tendermint as consensus engine and will be part of the Cosmos Network. Members will be rewarded with our native tokens according to the contributions they have made.
